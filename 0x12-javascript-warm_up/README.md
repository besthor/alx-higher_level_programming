# Background Context
## JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end

- For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
